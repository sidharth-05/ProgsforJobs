# ProgsForJobs: About

--> Simplifies what programming languages will be required for different jobs in the future. Quick Passion Project.

--> It's often hard to figure out which programming languages are best for certain jobs.

--> For example AI/ML jobs require python with an understanding of sci-kit or older languages like prolog. Or Data Science jobs use languages like R, or web development requires HTML and CSS.

--> Makes the job of newbie programmers easy, can open this application and selects which specific job or skillset to focus on and will be given properly visualized graphs consisting of which programming languages are best for the kid.


# Commands and Set-up Instructions


## python3 -m venv env && source ./env/bin/activate

This will set up an environment for your project, another alternative would be using a conda environment

## pip install ...... or pip3 install ......
 
This will depend on the current python you have but most people will have python3 so it is best to use pip3 install for any packages needed.

All the packages used in this project can be seen in the requirements.txt folder

## streamlit run filename.py

This is how to run a streamlit file. In our case this will be the main.py file. This is purely because streamlit does not just allow you to right click and run but so that you can open the file as a local host and make all parts of the program functional.

# API USED

This project will use the jobs API which is a REST API that contains aggregation data drawn from millions of job postings, with data pulled from various online sources

## source mypython/bin/activate

Activate env whenever you open the editor
